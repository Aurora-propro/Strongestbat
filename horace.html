      <h2>Poem</h2>
      <p>
        In blinking screens and midnight calls,<br>
        He captures laughs in pixel walls.<br>
        A quiet lens, a steady hand,<br>
        He turns the chaos into planned.
      </p>
      <p>
        When servers sleep and chats grow dim,<br>
        The stories still belong to him.<br>
        For every match the group forgets,<br>
        Horace keeps the silhouettes.
