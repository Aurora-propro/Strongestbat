      <h2>Poem</h2>
      <p>
        He sees beyond what others dream,<br>
        In Omori's dark and twisted theme.<br>
        A voice sharp as the words he'd say,<br>
        He dreams of futures far away.
      </p>
      <p>
        With naps between the endless streams,<br>
        He's lost within the Omori memes.<br>
        Yet underneath the mocking tone,<br>
        His loyalty is deeply shown.
