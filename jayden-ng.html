      <h2>Poem</h2>
      <p>
        A throne built tall but destined to fall,<br>
        His voice commands the crowded hall.<br>
        From owner's pride to passing the torch,<br>
        He guards the legacy from the porch.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Flipaclip frames and traced designs,<br>
        He marks his era in outlined lines.<br>
        Once king of choice, now stepping back,<br>
        He left the group a lasting track.
